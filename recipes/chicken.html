    <p><h2>This extra-crispy sheet pan chicken and veggies dinner is baked on one pan and packed with flavor!</h2></p>
    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 pound fresh green beans, trimmed</li>
        <li>1 small red potato, diced</li>
        <li>1 sweet bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup broccoli florets, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crums</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, pounded flat and excess fat removed</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. </li>
        <li>Combine oregano, parsley, paprika, garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper in a small bowl. </li>
        <li>Place green beans, potato, bell pepper, broccoli, and garlic onto the prepared sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with 1/2 of the seasoning mix; toss to coat. </li>
        <li>Place flour into a bowl. Place melted butter into a second bowl. Mix panko, 2/3 cup Parmesan cheese, and the remaining seasoning mix together in a third bowl. </li>
        <li>Slice chicken into 1 1/4-inch strips, then coat in flour. Dredge floured strips in melted butter, dripping excess butter back into the bowl. Press into Parmesan-panko mixture until heavily coated on both sides. </li>
        <li>Push veggies to one half of the sheet pan. Place coated chicken strips onto the other side. Sprinkle any remaining Parmesan-panko mixture over chicken, pressing to adhere. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken strips and stir veggies, then continue to bake until chicken juices run clear and veggies are crisp-tender, 10 to 15 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
    </ol>
